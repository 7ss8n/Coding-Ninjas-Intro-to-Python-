# Coding-Ninjas
This repository includes all the practice problems and assignments which I've solved during the Intro Course of Python Programming taught by Coding Ninjas. 
If you're unable to view the patterns properly in Jupyter notebook then double-click the cell to enlarge. 
File names which contain practice means the assignments of that particular topic. For an example, Patterns 1 Practice.ipynb means assignments file of first part of Patterns topic.
